The purpose of this project is to ~~display a graphic on the background of the website~~ create a printable PDF of the user's design. The user will be choose between lined, gridded or dotted layouts and adjust the spacing of the layout. And a background design can be chosen when one of the character class icons at the top is clicked.|
(Scope expanded on 2024/11/16)

~~ðŸ”¹  Now I'm working on phase two, which is placing the background images into a section.~~ - Completed 2024/11/16
ðŸ”¹  Then figure out how to draw in that section to make horizontal lines like that of notebook paper. 
ðŸ”¹  Then do the same but for graph paper with squares and dots.
ðŸ”¹  Then I would like to add a slider so that the user can determine the spacing they want to have.
ðŸ”¹  And finally let the user be able to download it as a PDF.  Of course should probably also allow the user to determine what dimensions they want the PDF to be. 
ðŸ”¹  Oh and of course I need to make the whole thing responsive as well.
